            <div>
                <p>
                    this is where I would like to have different charts with songs and albums.

                    Albums = billboard
                    Albums = Itunes
                    Albums = Spotify


                    maybe even have links to be able to listen to samples of top songs.


                    then add some decalls of music rotating around the screen.
                </p>
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default Charts;
